# cvwo-task-management

`cvwo-task-management` is a simple [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) web application for Computing for Voluntary Welfare Organisations (CVWO) AY2020/21 [Assignment: Ridding on Rails](https://github.com/CVWO/setup-guide).

## Goals

- __Managing tasks__  
Implement a todo manager to keep track of all the tasks that you have to do. As a start, your todo manager should be able to perform basic CRUD operations. CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. They are the basic functionality that your application should have.
- __Catergorising tasks__  
Implement a tagging system to organise your tasks so that they are easy to search for. Since we are all busy people, your todo manager would likely fill up fast. Hence, it is important to be able to organise your tasks and search through them.
- __Optional tasks__  
(to be updated)
